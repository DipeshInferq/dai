## Introduction
Inferq - DAi is an autonomous system or third eye that is capable of guiding the user to find out the specific objects by sensing the environment with very few user inputs. The proposed system is being trained on daily used objects to supervise the user and find it with very little user effort to make life a little easy. 
MobilenetSSD-v2 object detection network trained on COCO dataset is used to detect objects and hand detection network trained to detect human hand in different poses which are trained on  --- dataset, both the networks are inference to run parallelly on depth-ai hardware.
